## Flower Recognition

In this project, I created a Flower Recognition Project...

Link to [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)

This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers.

The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images.

The pictures are divided into five classes: "Chamomile", "Tulip", "Rose", "Sunflower", "Dandelion".

For each class there are about 800 photos.

I build Two Models

1. [Flower Recognition with ResNet9](https://github.com/swapnilbhange/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Flowers%20Recognition/flower-recognition-resnet9.ipynb)

2. [Flower Recognition using Transfer learning with pretrained ResNet34](https://github.com/swapnilbhange/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Flowers%20Recognition/transfer-learning-with-pre-trained-resnet34.ipynb)
